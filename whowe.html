    <p>
      Hi! My name is Sai Nay (online name for privacy concerns) and I'm the coder for this website. I'm a teenager
      living in Virginia and I like watching anime and learning javascript in my free time. I will not disclose the 
      name of my friend that researched and found the sources about the candidates
    </p>

    <p>
      Last month or so, I decided to search up "news today!". After some careless scrolling, I saw that the gubernatorial
      election was coming up soon. And I was simply shocked. I knew nothing about the candidates or anything that was happening.
      I asked my dad, he didn't even know the names of the candidates. I asked my sister, she couldn't come up with anything either.
      It was then when I realized, many people want to know about the election, they're just not as unemployed as me, meaning that
      they simply don't have enough time, and I get it. Time in such a fast-paced society flies faster than a hurricane breeze.
      Not everyone can catch up on election news or find complete and easy to acsess information.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was then when I decided that I wanted to make a website to teach people about our local election in Virginia. 
      Teaming up with a friend, we made this website (and so sorry for publishing it so late)
    </p>
